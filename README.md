## 🌟 Key Features

### 📋 1. Guided One-Time Health Assessment

- **Smart Onboarding**: First-time users are automatically redirected to a multi-step health questionnaire on signup/login.
- **No Repetition**: Once completed, returning users skip directly to the dashboard.
- **Comprehensive Input**: Assessment covers age, gender, height, weight, smoking, exercise, alcohol, family history, and current symptoms.
- **Anytime Reassessment**: Users can update their profile and retake the assessment from the **Profile** page.

### 📊 2. Intelligent Risk Dashboard

- **Clinical Risk Calculation**: Computes scores using **FINDRISC** (Type 2 Diabetes) and **Framingham** (Heart Disease & Hypertension) equations for clinical transparency.
- **Action Impact Simulation**: Tests multiple realistic lifestyle changes and ranks them by impact. Users see _"Exercise 30 min/day can reduce your risk by 19%"_ with visual confidence metrics.
- **Risk Driver Breakdown**: Visualizes risk into weighted contributors (e.g., Sedentary Lifestyle 38%, BMI 27%) to help users understand _why_ their risk is high.
- **Progress Tracking**: Historical snapshots of risk progression over time.
- **Dynamic Journey Card**: Shows assessment completion status, recommended next step, and profile age.

### 🎮 3. Interactive Action Impact Explorer (Simulator)

- **What-If Analysis**: Simulate the effect of lifestyle changes before committing to them.

## ⚡ Performance Optimization & Local-First Architecture

HealthGuard AI features a premium, production-grade performance architecture engineered to ensure a sub-second Time-to-Interactive (TTI) and bulletproof offline resilience:

### 1. Local-First Architecture (`PendingSyncQueue`)

- **Instant Flow**: Submitting the health assessment calculates risk metrics locally, updates UI context, and redirects the user to the dashboard instantly.
- **Background Pipeline**: Profile synchronizations, Firestore writes, and AI advice generation run concurrently in the background using `profileSyncService`.
- **Offline Recovery**: If network connection is lost, updates are held in `hg.pending-sync.v1` and automatically synchronized when the browser detects a restore of internet connectivity (`online` events).

### 2. Consolidated Dashboard Bootstrap Endpoint

- **Unified Query**: Replaced 5 sequential REST calls with a single consolidated `GET /api/dashboard/bootstrap` endpoint.
- **Concurrent Execution**: Queries user state, expert reviews, and nudges in parallel via `Promise.all`.
- **Dynamic Calculation**: Attributes risk drivers and ranks action priorities on-the-fly, completely bypassing Gemini API dependencies for initial dashboard load.

### 3. Decoupled AI Pipeline & Hashing Cache

- **Decoupled API**: Clinical calculation (`POST /api/risk/calculate`) is separated from AI guidance (`POST /api/risk/advice`), allowing the app to respond in under 100ms.
- **Snapshot Cache**: Generates a 64-bit payload hash for the profile state. If the profile has not changed, the app retrieves the cached clinical recommendation from Firestore in under 200ms, saving Gemini API resources.

### 4. Advanced Bundle Optimization & Route Splitting

- **Route-level Chunking**: Split all main views (Dashboard, Scanner, Progress, Expert Review, Assessment, Report) into dynamically imported TanStack Router lazy routes (`.lazy.tsx` files).
- **On-Demand Imports**: Dynamically loads heavy modules like `jsPDF` only when the user clicks "Download Report".
- **Result**: Reduced the initial JS bundle payload size from **2.3 MB** to **586 kB** (a 75% reduction).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+ and npm
- A **Gemini API Key** from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) (free tier available)
- (Optional) Firebase project credentials for cloud persistence and auth

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
# Root directory (frontend)
npm install

# Backend
cd backend && npm install && cd ..
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

#### Frontend (Root `.env`)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Firebase configuration (get these from Firebase Console)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your-firebase-api-key"
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-project.firebaseapp.com"
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-project.firebasestorage.app"
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your-sender-id"
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="your-app-id"

# API endpoint
VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:5000"
```

#### Backend (`backend/.env`)

Create `.env` in the backend directory:

```env
# Gemini API key (get from https://aistudio.google.com/)
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"

# Optional: Firebase service account for cloud persistence
# FIREBASE_SA_KEY_PATH="./service-account.json"
```

> **💡 Note**: Without Firebase service account credentials, the backend automatically falls back to **in-memory mock storage**. This is perfect for local development and demos — all user data is preserved during the session but not persisted to the cloud.

### 3. Start Development Servers

**Run both servers at once (recommended)**:

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

Opens:

- Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- Backend: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

**Or run them separately**:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Frontend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Backend
cd backend && npm run dev
```

### 4. First-Time User Flow

1. Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
2. **Sign up** with email (or **Log in** if you already have an account)
3. Complete the one-time **Health Assessment** (you'll be redirected automatically)
4. Land on your personalized **Dashboard** featuring:
   - Your risk scores (FINDRISC for Diabetes, Framingham for Heart Disease)
   - Key risk drivers (what contributes most to your risk)
   - Action impacts (what lifestyle changes help most)

### 5. Production Build

```bash
# Frontend
npm run build
npm run preview  # Test production build locally

# Backend
cd backend && npm run build
npm start        # Run production server
```

## 📱 Feature Highlights

### 🎯 What Makes HealthGuard AI Different

1. **Evidence-Based**: Uses FINDRISC (2007) and Framingham (30-year cohort) equations, not guesswork.

2. **Personalized**: Every recommendation — from food scores to action impacts — is calculated for YOUR specific risk profile.

3. **Explainable**: Risk drivers show exactly which factors matter most for you (e.g., "Sedentary Lifestyle 38%").

4. **Safe**: AI-generated content is validated against clinical guardrails to prevent diagnosis claims or inappropriate medication advice.

5. **Accessible**:
   - Three language support (English, Hindi, Gujarati)
   - Regional cuisine preferences (Indian veg/non-veg)
   - Zero upfront medical knowledge required

6. **Real Expert Access**: Not just an AI chatbot — users can request review by real clinicians with full health context.

7. **Offline Ready**: Local storage fallback + mock backend means it works even without Firebase credentials during development.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "API_URL is undefined"

**Solution**: Ensure `VITE_API_URL` is set in `.env` and the backend is running on port 5000.

### Issue: "Gemini API returns 403 Forbidden"

**Solution**: Verify your `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `backend/.env` is valid and not a placeholder.

### Issue: "Firebase config error"

**Solution**: Either:

- Set all `VITE_FIREBASE_*` environment variables correctly, OR
- Leave them empty to use mock fallback (recommended for local dev)

### Issue: "Changes don't reflect in production build"

**Solution**:

```bash
npm run build  # Clear dist/ and rebuild
npm run preview  # Test locally before deploying
```

### Issue: "Firestore security rules blocking requests"

**Solution**: Check `firestore.rules` — ensure your rules allow read/write for authenticated users.

## 📚 Architecture Decisions

### Why TanStack Router?

File-based routing with Next.js-like DX, but with more control and zero server requirements.

### Why Gemini API?

- Multimodal (vision + text)
- JSON schema support for reliable structured responses
- Generous free tier
- No authentication complexity (just API key)

### Why FINDRISC + Framingham?

- Peer-reviewed, widely used in clinics
- Well-calibrated thresholds
- Transparent calculation formulas
- Non-proprietary (can be audited)

### Why Firebase?

- Auth is battle-tested
- Firestore is real-time (great for expert chat)
- Authentication is simple (no JWT complexity)
- Scaling is automatic
- **But**: Can run entirely offline with mock fallback

### Why Express + TypeScript backend?

- Lightweight and familiar
- Full type safety with TypeScript
- Easy to add new routes and services
- Good for microservices
